/*! \mainpage Introduction

Enterprises are constantly faced with decisions that require picking from a set of actions based on 
contextual information. Real world reinforcement-based techniques are effective tools in aiding 
decision making; they rely on free interaction data to "predict" and "learn". This library implements 
an interface for reinforcement-based prediction based on contextual bandits.

Reinforcement Learning Loop

RL Inference API 
----------------
This API allows the developer to perform local inference and ship the actions and feedback
to an online trainer running in the Azure cloud.  It also periodically refreshes its copy
of the model. 

API Usage: Basic steps to using the RL Inference API
----------------------------------------------------
reinforcement_learning::live_model class is the interface to RL Inference API
- Instantiate and Initialize live_model
\snippet examples/basic_usage_cpp/basic_usage_cpp.cc (1) Instantiate Inference API using config
\snippet examples/basic_usage_cpp/basic_usage_cpp.cc (2) Initialize the API
- choose_rank() to choose an action from a list of actions
\snippet examples/basic_usage_cpp/basic_usage_cpp.cc (3) Choose an action
- (Optional) report_outcome() to provide feedback on choosen action  
\snippet examples/basic_usage_cpp/basic_usage_cpp.cc (5) Report outcome
